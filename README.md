> ⚠️ **ATTENTION**: This project is currently in the POC (Proof of Concept) phase and contains bugs that prevent it from working. I'm working on solving these problems. The main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a starter combining WXT and Nuxt UI v3 for the development of web extensions. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
